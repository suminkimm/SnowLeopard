        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> The snow leopard, or the Pantheria uncia, is a large cat that lives in the mountains of Central and South Asia. These highly elusive cats are able to withstand cold temperatures at high altitudes thanks to their beautiful thick fur. Rugged terrain is no problem for snow leopards, as they are well-balanced and powerful leapers. Unfortunately, these cats are endangered, and only 3,920 to 6,390 snow leopards are left in the wild.

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p> Snow leopards mainly prey on blue sheep, or the bharal, that live in Tibet and Himalaya. They also hunt the mountain ibex that are found over most of the range. Despite the fact that they can kill animals up to three times their weight, snow leopards also hunt smaller prey such as marmots, hares, and birds.

        <h2>Adaptations</h2>
        <p> Snow leopards have adaptations that allow them to survive their tough environment. At high altitudes, oxygen is scarce. However, snow leopards have well-developed chests that help in draw in oxygen from the thin air. Their short forelimbs, large snow-shoe paws, long hindlimbs, and long, thick tails help them maintain balance on the rocky terrain. In order to withstand the cold, their enlarged nasal cavities warm the frigid air before it reaches the lungs. Their thick coat of dense, woolly underfur also protect them from the low temperatures of the mountains.
